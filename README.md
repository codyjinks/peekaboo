Financial reward is seen by the recipient as a tangible form of
recognition.There are other ways whereby appreciation is expressed
for what has been contributed.
If recognition is not given, an individual can feel unnoticed, unvalued
and unrewarded.This leads to a drop in motivation and energy levels.
Recognition should be formal or informal, for the individual and/or
the team, as appropriate.
In giving recognition, you should try to ensure that you:
1
treat everyone in a fair and equal way
2
reward real achievements or contributions
3
reflect the core values of the organisation
4
use it to guide and encourage all concerned
5
give it in public if possible
6
give it formally and informally
7
give it genuinely and sincerely.
Other than financial payments, any words of recognition could be
reinforced by giving:
•     time off (with pay)
•     tickets for an event or dinner out
•     small gift
•     special project of importance
•     a change in job title.
It is a good idea to back up words of praise or recognition with some
tangible gift.
Find out what is going on, share praise received with subordinates,
and say thank-you more often, because people really value positive
recognition and are motivated by it.
Know people’s names – that is the basic form of recognition!
